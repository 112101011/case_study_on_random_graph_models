| file | description |
|:-----|:------------|
| [power_law_example.ipynb](power_law_example.ipynb) | In this example I plotted a graph of two variables which are related by power law |
| [real_network.ipynb](real_network.ipynb) | check_properties.check() takes a graphs adjacency list as argument and prints the properties like average_path_length, clustering_coefficient and plots degree_distribution of the graph |
| [sample_graph.ipynb](sample_graph.ipynb) | In this file, I created a graph and used check_properties.check() from [real_network.ipynb](real_network.ipynb) to get values/plot of the above mentioned 3 properties |
| [facebook.ipynb](facebook.ipynb) | In this file, I created a graph of facebook data set from [face_book_dataset](../face_book_dataset/), and found the values/plot of the above mentioned 3 properties |
| [erdos_renyi.ipynb](erdos_renyi.ipynb) | The file gives an understanding of how ER (G(n,p)) model properties vary as we play with n and p (n - number of vertices in graph, p - probability that there is an edge between two vertices of graph G) |
| [barabasi_albert_model.ipynb](barabasi_albert_model.ipynb) | In this file I simulated BA model, where I checked the properties of BA random graph model at 0th, 10th, 50th, 100th, 500th and 1000th instance of time |
